PRI-917 v0.3.3 (OD-PRI917-05): Reuse Review Gate — automatic candidate intake now consults the semantic reuse evaluation capability before creating a Principle.

A `reuse` recommendation parks the candidate (`refused/reuse_pending_owner`): no Principle is written, no evidence is appended, the candidate stays pending for the Owner, and the bridge emits an observable `reuse_gate_triggered` event plus a `reuse_review_required` outcome pointing at `pd candidate review --decide reuse|create`. `create`/`uncertain` recommendations and every evaluation failure degrade to normal creation (learning never blocks). `reuseEvaluation.enabled=false` restores the exact pre-v0.3.3 behavior.

Also fixes the R5 "two-heads-block" defect: `pd candidate review --decide reuse` no longer lets the PRI-442 admission pre-check reject low-confidence candidates — a reuse verdict creates nothing, so the ledger-quality gate does not apply (the `--decide create` pre-check is unchanged).

PRI-939 Option A — reuse gate degradation visibility. The semantic reuse evaluation's unavailable state is now Owner-visible: reuse_gate_triggered and reuse_evaluation_unavailable persist to the workspace critical-events.jsonl sink (recommended deliberately excluded — no second decision log), the four short-lived CLI commands (pain record / pain retry / diagnose / candidate review) emit through a workspace-scoped telemetry emitter instead of the unsubscribed singleton, the intake gate carries the hook outcome on the CREATE result so CLI outputs show why duplicate protection did not run, and `pd health` summarizes the last unavailable event. Gate behavior unchanged (Rule 4, park semantics, reuseDecision/reuseEvidence untouched).

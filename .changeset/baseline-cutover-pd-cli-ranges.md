'@principles/pd-cli': patch
---

Baseline-cutover dependency-contract fix: the internal dependency ranges now match the aligned component versions (principles-disciple ^2.0.1, @principles/host-runtime ^0.7.7, @principles/codex-adapter ^0.4.4). Without this, npm would nest stale registry copies inside the workspace after version alignment (ERR-131 single-copy violation; the 2026-09-19 release-train failure mode).

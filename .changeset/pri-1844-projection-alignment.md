PR #1844 follow-up: the Governance Focus prompt-injection forecast and the PRI-890 approve-time budget check now read `buildLivePromptInjectionProjection` (host-runtime), which follows the SAME injection route the agent uses — with `abstraction_layer_v1` off (the live default) the forecast replays the plugin's PromptActivationReader → trimToBudget chain instead of always rendering with the shared-path directive wrapper. Previously a saturated 2000-char budget was over-forecast (~3/11 principles "injected" vs the real 9/11), so the Focus page badge and approve warnings overstated budget pressure. Principle selection, FIFO ordering, injection behavior and the budget algorithm are unchanged; parity and boundary regression tests pin the projection to the live path.

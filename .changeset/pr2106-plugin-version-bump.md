Bump the Codex plugin manifest 0.1.1 → 0.2.0 and the WorkBuddy plugin manifest 0.1.0 → 0.2.0. The unified four-skill set (#2106) changed both plugins' shipped content without moving their manifest versions; Codex cache updates key on that version, so users re-running `codex plugin add` could be served the already-installed 0.1.1 payload and never receive the new skills. The WorkBuddy same-version refresh path is content-safe, but a versioned cache dir makes the upgrade observable. Includes a cross-version WorkBuddy upgrade regression (new cache dir + registration repoint + governance data preserved) and parameterizes the delivery tests off the shipped manifest version.

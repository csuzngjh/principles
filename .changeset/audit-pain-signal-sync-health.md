Signal detection sync-path and observability hardening (AUDIT-P2-01/P2-02, 2026-10-21 remediation): defer all health-counter file writes off the before_prompt_build synchronous call stack (degraded/zero-hit paths previously did a synchronous read-modify-write per message); add stage2Invocations and stage2BatchSkipped counters with backward-compatible signal-health parsing and pd config doctor display; add sync-path regression tests and a repeatable detectSync performance baseline. SQLite queue records stay synchronous by design.

OPT-002 (runtime-v2 barrel narrowing): the plugin's satellite bundles no longer pull the LLM SDK graph. Six shared plugin modules switched their VALUE imports from the `@principles/core/runtime-v2` barrel to the eight narrow leaf subpaths (type-only barrel imports unchanged; exported names unchanged), and `@principles/core` exports gained those additive subpaths (`./runtime-v2/store/workspace-leak-guard`, `./runtime-v2/feedback/redact-sensitive`, `./runtime-v2/types/event-types`, `./runtime-v2/trajectory-schema`, `./runtime-v2/internalization/{rule-host-input-builder,rule-context-v2,behavior-example-pack,tool-semantic-registry}`). governance-audit.js drops 2,783,013 → 70,786 bytes (−97.5%) and rulehost-evidence.js 2,826,401 → 60,244 bytes (−97.9%); bundle.js is byte-identical (4,151,557) — the main package keeps its LLM runtime through its own direct barrel import. `runtime-v2/index.ts` and all existing exports are untouched.

Security audit run-1 remediation (findings verified against eabbde6d, applied on ccc69252):

- **RuleCode enforcement is now content-bound** (audit HIGH `rulecode-approval-content-unbound`): the production gate and the OpenClaw plugin RuleHost re-verify the current `pi_artifacts` row against the `activation_decisions.artifact_digest` recorded at Owner promotion time before compiling it. A workspace-local rewrite of `content_json` (or lineage fields) is now skipped with a structured `artifact_content_tampered` warning instead of silently executing unapproved code. Rows without a recorded decision (legacy activations) keep their prior behavior. Adds `mapPiArtifactRow`/`PiArtifactRow` exports (the single `pi_artifacts` row→snapshot mapping) so enforcement reproduces the promotion-time digest byte-for-byte.
- **Replay evaluate is hard-bounded** (audit MEDIUM `rulecode.replay.in-process-evaluate-no-hard-timeout`): pre-activation replay runs each evaluate call through a precompiled vm script with a 2000ms hard timeout — a looping LLM-authored candidate now fails its replay case instead of hanging the console server, evaluator worker, or CLI process.
- **Governance-store unavailability leaves a durable trace** (audit MEDIUM `gate-failopen-allow-on-state-corruption`): when `state.db` is missing or unreadable, the gate/plugin record a best-effort marker under `~/.pd/enforcement-health/` (outside the agent-writable workspace), and the console governance read model distinguishes "state.db deleted after initialization — enforcement degraded (fail-open)" from a never-initialized workspace.
- **Console refuses unauthenticated non-loopback binds** (audit MEDIUM `pd-console-noauth-nonloopback-bind`): the loopback-only invariant now keys on the effective authentication state (token-less default included), not just the explicit `--no-auth` flag.
- **Plugin honors an explicit conversation-access opt-out** (audit LOW `openclaw-plugin:conversation-access-autofix-overrides-explicit-owner-opt-out`): the auto-fix repairs only an absent `allowConversationAccess` flag; an explicit `false` (the documented turn-off) is preserved and surfaced as an honored Owner opt-out instead of being silently rewritten on every gateway start.

RAH-1 (PRI-905): production builds now exclude test code (tsconfig.build.json: *.test.*, __tests__/, __fixtures__/, *.spec.*), clean dist before building, and fail the build if compiled test artifacts appear in dist. Published dist shrinks accordingly (@principles/core tarball was ~57% test artifacts by size); runtime API, source layout and vitest behavior are unchanged. Test files are still type-checked via the new `typecheck` (tsc --noEmit) scripts, wired into verify:merge.

PRI-866 sourcePainId reader convergence: pd-cli's two inline sourcePainId parsers now delegate to the core canonical reader (exported from @principles/core/runtime-v2), and the rulehost pipeline dreamer-task lookup normalizes both sides at the comparison boundary — historical rows or queries carrying surrounding whitespace no longer miss their dreamer seed and are no longer rejected with a misleading no_dreamer_task_seeded.

Phase B — Shared Correction Detection (SPEC-PD-PAIN-SEMANTICS-AND-DETECTION-ARCHITECTURE-001 v0.3 / v0.3.1).

Behavior contract changes (intentional, per the v0.3 spec):

- Stage 1 (P-1): matched keywords inside paired quotes no longer constitute STRONG; third-person reported and negated contexts — and the downgraded colloquial terms `我说的是` / `都说了` — are Stage-2 candidates only. `他说这是错的` can no longer reach STRONG through the Codex bare-substring path.
- P-2 (D5 reversal): LLM-learned keywords never earn `high` precision from TP/FP history; they only enter Stage 2. Owner-promoted and seed terms keep the weight-based rule.
- P-3: a shared confidence gate (`evaluateStage2ConfidenceGate`) distinguishes CORRECTION / NONE / pending; low confidence and LLM errors are never a terminal NONE. Constants: 0.7 / 0.7, MAX_ATTEMPTS=5, TTL=72h.
- Pending candidates: ambiguous Codex/WorkBuddy Stage-1 candidates are now persisted as `pending_llm_review` rows in the existing `governance_signal_admissions` table (zero DDL) instead of being silently dropped. New terminal decisions `resolved_none` / `abandoned`; `admitOne` returns the pending/terminal semantic instead of an empty `already_admitted` id. CAS claim/complete/settle, idempotent transitions, crash recovery, aggregate 60s / ≤2 candidates per worker cycle.
- PainIngress: `ensureGovernanceDiagnosticianTask` derives provenance from `evaluatePainIngress` instead of hardcoding `host_context_bound`; `PainIngressCorrelationV1` gains a `workbuddy` variant; the diagnostician context assembler no longer drops `hostKind='workbuddy'`.

Stage-2 classification is now constructed by one shared host-runtime factory (`createSignalClassifierForWorkspace` / `createSignalLlmClassifier`), used by both workers and the OpenClaw plugin; no second model runtime was added. `EARNED_PRECISION_MIN_TP` is removed from `@principles/host-runtime` because learned keywords no longer use it.

# @principles/pd-cli

## 1.152.13

### Patch Changes

- 99e6a8c: RAH-1 (PRI-905): production builds now exclude test code (tsconfig.build.json: *.test.*, __tests__/, __fixtures__/, *.spec.*), clean dist before building, and fail the build if compiled test artifacts appear in dist. Published dist shrinks accordingly (@principles/core tarball was ~57% test artifacts by size); runtime API, source layout and vitest behavior are unchanged. Test files are still type-checked via the new `typecheck` (tsc --noEmit) scripts, wired into verify:merge.
- 454eccf: RAH-2 (PRI-906): add a `files` publish whitelist (`dist`, `README.md`) to @principles/pd-cli. The package previously had no whitelist, so npm shipped the entire working tree: 111 uncompiled source files, the full 111-file test suite, and 2 development scripts alongside dist (~450 published files). Runtime surface (bin/exports/main → dist) is unchanged.

## 1.152.12

### Patch Changes

- 75b4ac4: PRI-866 sourcePainId reader convergence: pd-cli's two inline sourcePainId parsers now delegate to the core canonical reader (exported from @principles/core/runtime-v2), and the rulehost pipeline dreamer-task lookup normalizes both sides at the comparison boundary — historical rows or queries carrying surrounding whitespace no longer miss their dreamer seed and are no longer rejected with a misleading no_dreamer_task_seeded.

## 1.152.11

### Patch Changes

- 8424d60: Baseline-cutover dependency-contract fix: the internal dependency ranges now match the aligned component versions (principles-disciple ^2.0.1, @principles/host-runtime ^0.7.7, @principles/codex-adapter ^0.4.4). Without this, npm would nest stale registry copies inside the workspace after version alignment (ERR-131 single-copy violation; the 2026-09-19 release-train failure mode).

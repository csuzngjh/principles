## 0.9.2

### Patch Changes

- eaf52c4: PRI-982 (SPEC-PD-IAER-001 FR-02/FR-04/§4.2): consumer-side evidence preflight + authoritative channel routing for Artificer. The shared consumer cycle resolves the target channel from `pi_metadata.channel` (seed-time bridge authority): only `code_tool_hook` tasks enter ArtificerL2, prompt-channel tasks keep their legal non-L2 pipeline, unresolvable channels refuse to guess. `code_tool_hook` tasks pass a new `preflightArtificerOwnerEvidence` gate BEFORE any runner construction: no Owner selection or an invalid one atomically transitions the task to `needs_human_review` (CAS via `updateTaskIfDiagnosticJsonUnchanged`, humanReviewContext with the stable FR-04 reasonCode + nextAction) with zero LLM calls, zero run records and no attemptCount consumption; a missing host `behaviorEvidence` port degrades observably and leaves the task pending (SPEC §6.2). New optional PITaskMetadata field `ownerEvidenceSelection` (single shape authority shared with the readiness gate; bad values fail the whole metadata closed). The OpenClaw auto-consumer wires the production `BehaviorExamplePackAssembler` through the port (same assembly contract as run-rulehost). ArtificerRunner/prompt builder become channel-aware so the evidence contract no longer kills prompt-channel tasks, while injected packs keep full v2 echo protection on every channel. New telemetry events `artificer_evidence_readiness_checked` / `artificer_blocked_on_owner_evidence` (the latter persisted via the workspace critical-events allowlist).
- eaf52c4: PRI-984 (SPEC-PD-IAER-001 FR-08): unified run-correlation payload for the Artificer evidence telemetry. `artificer_evidence_readiness_checked`, `artificer_blocked_on_owner_evidence`, `artificer_owner_evidence_attached` and `artificer_owner_evidence_resumed` now carry a single shared correlation block (`artificer-run-correlation.ts`, one definition, no per-site drift): taskId, attemptNumber (the task's attemptCount at event-write time; post-resume that is the new budget start certified by the authority reset), workspace, agentKind ('artificer'), executionMode ('preflight' | 'recovery'), a reasonCode on every event (the FR-04 code where one exists, otherwise the operation status — previously the ready/attached verdicts carried no reason field), and evidenceDigestPrefix (first 12 chars of the behavior-pack contentDigest — auditable without pack content; previously only the blocked/attach/resume paths referenced evidence). persistentRunId / adapterRunId stay semantically absent by design: every event fires before the lease-minted run row exists (consumer preflight runs on a dry-run wake — zero run rows) or outside any runtime invocation, and no placeholder ids are fabricated; the correlation joins the next lease's deterministic `run_<taskId>_<attempt>` row through (taskId, attemptNumber), proven on real SQLite by the recovery T10 integration test. The consumer cycle passes its workspaceDir into the preflight so production payloads always identify the workspace. rc-8: bounded scalars only — no raw tool output, no private trajectories.

### Patch Changes

- 6e60d84: SPEC-CODEX-PAIN-CLOSURE-001: Codex 痛苦反馈闭环修复。
  
  - CR-01（PRI-960）：工具执行结果三值契约（success/failure/unknown）——缺失退出码不再伪造为 0，snake_case/camelCase 退出码全位置读取；tool_calls 增补 tool_use_id 连接列；consent 门控的 transcript 事实路径把文本型 live 观测升级为宿主核实的最终结果。
  - CR-02/CR-03（PRI-958/959）：明确 Owner 陈述（--owner-statement / PD记录痛苦：前缀，≤500 字拒绝不截断）仅满足空输入证据准入条件；候选行新增 admission_json——不可变评估历史 + 当前指针 + 独立处理进度域；CLI intake 写入许可以持久化完整门禁为准（部分检查仅作快速预拒）。
  - CR-05：诊断成功后的准入/收编/seed 断点由 worker 有界续接（不重跑诊断 LLM，最多 3 次自动尝试，终态可读）。
  - CR-06：pd pain retry 支持 --owner-statement/--dry-run/--confirm 的授权恢复语义。
  - CR-07：Codex 用户消息 `PD记录痛苦：<反馈>` 前缀入口（UserPromptSubmit Hook，登记→任务→回执，无 LLM，幂等）；插件交付 pd-record-pain skill。
  - CR-08：worker 周期活性事实持久化（readiness ≠ liveness）；pd codex worker --status 与 Companion 分开报告活性。
- 0f94f8c: PRI-954 (R1 F10): bounded stage fairness for the internalization consumer — oldest-ready-stage-first.
  
  - core: `InternalizationQueueReadModel` ReadyTask entries now carry the task row's `createdAt` (queue age; additive field, falls back to the hydrated pi-metadata timestamp for legacy rows) so consumers can implement age-based fairness without a second query.
  - host-runtime: `runInternalizationConsumerCycle` starts each cycle's stage scan at the stage owning the globally OLDEST ready task instead of always dreamer-first. Under a continuous stream of new dreamer tasks (each real Pain creates one) downstream stages (philosopher → … → rollout_reviewer) were previously starved for an unbounded number of cycles — measured at 35+ minutes philosopher starvation with a 13-deep backlog in the 2026-10-13 dogfood run. The new order removes the priority-order starvation (the oldest ready task is served before newer arrivals) with no concurrency, no persisted scheduler state (works across one-shot `pd codex worker --once` processes), and with leases, idempotency, dependency order, and single-task-per-cycle semantics unchanged. Ties keep the original priority order; tasks without a readable createdAt never jump the queue.

## 0.8.2

### Patch Changes

- 4b84634: Advance the Marketplace runtime pin to the already-published npm versions that carry the Phase 1 intervention-evidence face: codex-adapter 0.5.1 (codex-evidence-recorder), host-runtime 0.8.1 (intervention-evidence-ingress), core 1.291.2 (published by the 2026-10-11T03:51Z release train, carries the #1982 evaluator template-pairing fix). Verified by `npm run check:runtime-pin` (packaged capability probe S1–S5 PASS against npm-installed bytes) plus tarball content inspection of all three evidence modules (re-run against 1.291.2 after the train published it). The previous pin (0.4.7 / 0.7.11 / 1.287.6) predates the Phase 1 evidence recorder, so officially installed Codex hosts had no intervention-evidence surface (acceptance 2026-10-10 §7.2 G-Codex-1).

## 0.8.0

### Minor Changes

- d5732f8: PD v2 Phase 1 Evidence Foundation (ADR-0027): normalized intervention evidence ledger.
  
  - core: intervention evidence contract + deterministic normalizer (rc-1..rc-5 trust boundary, anti-forgery cross-field rules), append-only SQLite ledger tables inside the existing state.db (idempotent same-source replay, reported source conflicts, immutable records, activation occurrence snapshots), busyTimeoutMs connection option, and the four-query audit read contract.
  - host-runtime: shared intervention evidence ingress — the single validated entry every host source uses; never throws, never waits on locks (busyTimeoutMs 0), degrades with structured reason + nextAction.
  - openclaw-plugin (principles-disciple): evidence wiring on both legacy and shared routes — prompt delivery attempts (submitted/attempted, host consumption never claimed), enforcement chains on gate block/auto-correct (runtime_loaded delivery, runtime_verified application with explicit proof boundary, episode, effect), agent_claimed self-report mirroring; gated by the existing principle_receipt_ledger flag.
  - codex-adapter: evidence adapter on the shared ingress — UserPromptSubmit delivery attempts after the durable event-log line, deny chains recorded only after successful stdout encoding; honest capability matrix (self_report Unsupported, enforcement Unknown per PRI-780).
  - create-principles-disciple (ships pd-console): four read-only evidence-audit queries under /api/v1/receipts/evidence-audit plus the authenticated Owner outcome input POST /api/v1/evidence/outcomes (closed body contract, server-derived actor), and an evidence-audit section on the principle detail page.
  
  No effectiveness scoring, ranking, or automatic governance action anywhere (Phase 1 records facts only).
- 0b981bb: 提示词容量与生效反馈修复（PD_PROMPT_CAPACITY_V1，阶段 A/B1/B2/C）：
  
  - core：`listEntryLine` 列表行格式单一权威；prompt 版本替换——dispatcher `supersedeActivationId` 通道 + state store 单事务 `replacePromptActivation`（新激活+不可变 supersede 决策+旧版停用，故障回滚不留双活）；`detectPromptReplacementTarget` / `buildOwnerRevisionArtifact`（复用真实 Scribe 内容合同）；Scribe prompt v5 正文最短充分要求。
  - host-runtime：宿主事实绑定的有效注入路由解析（声明∪pain_events，Codex 恒共享、OpenClaw 按 flag、未知不猜测）；投影合同扩展（unit/计费范围/超长透传/诊断截断标记）；单一 `checkPromptArtifactDeliverability` 写入前预检；激活级注入状态读取；注入事件诚实读模型（无日志=unknown 非零）。
  - pd-cli：`pd activation approve --target-host` + prompt 写入前容量门（拒绝零写入、单一 JSON、结构化 nextAction）。
  - console（随 create-principles-disciple 发布）：审批预检门与 422 拒绝、未确认宿主横幅与请求级目标宿主、激活页注入状态与「修改为可注入版本」入口、替换事务 UX。

## 0.7.14

### Patch Changes

- 0139c88: PRI-939 Option A — reuse gate degradation visibility. The semantic reuse evaluation's unavailable state is now Owner-visible: reuse_gate_triggered and reuse_evaluation_unavailable persist to the workspace critical-events.jsonl sink (recommended deliberately excluded — no second decision log), the four short-lived CLI commands (pain record / pain retry / diagnose / candidate review) emit through a workspace-scoped telemetry emitter instead of the unsubscribed singleton, the intake gate carries the hook outcome on the CREATE result so CLI outputs show why duplicate protection did not run, and `pd health` summarizes the last unavailable event. Gate behavior unchanged (Rule 4, park semantics, reuseDecision/reuseEvidence untouched).

## 0.7.12

### Patch Changes

- 7421049: The console's prompt-injection budget forecast now mirrors the production
  selection policy instead of silently defaulting to the legacy FIFO prefix
  (PRI-935). The forecast previously called the budget selector without its
  round key, which did not make it conservative — it selected a different
  policy, one that structurally excludes the newest activation from every
  truncated selection. The console therefore told the Owner an approved
  principle "will NOT enter agent behavior until older ones are deactivated"
  while the live injection path rotates and injects it within a bounded number
  of user turns, pushing Owners to deactivate healthy principles.
  
  buildLivePromptInjectionProjection now accepts the caller's round key and
  reports the policy it actually ran, the eligible count, whether production
  rotates on this route, and the set of activations reachable under some round.
  Reachability is a property of the policy rather than of a single round, so a
  console with no session round key can still distinguish an activation that is
  merely rotated out of the current window from one that is genuinely starved.
  Approve now emits injection_budget_queued for the queued case — with a bounded
  "within at most N consecutive user turns" statement and an explicit note that
  deactivating older principles is not required — and reserves
  injection_budget_excluded for real starvation, no longer asserting a FIFO
  ordering the production route does not use. The pre-decision queue badge and
  both locales follow the same policy, and the raw English server text is
  collapsed behind a native details element so the toast no longer renders as one
  mixed Chinese/English block (still preserved verbatim).
  
  The shared host route deliberately passes no round key and continues to report
  legacy_fifo_prefix_v1, so cross-host fairness remains PRI-930 and is not
  claimed here. All new projection fields are optional; payloads without them
  validate as before and render policy-agnostic copy.
- Updated dependencies [b50ec74]
  - @principles/core@1.287.7

## 0.7.11

### Patch Changes

- 50ed22e: Prompt principle injection now rotates deterministically under the fixed
  2000-char budget instead of always packing the oldest prefix, so a live,
  eligible, individually-fitting principle can no longer be permanently starved
  by its position (PRI-904). The rotation round is the session-local user-turn
  ordinal already persisted in the trajectory database — an existing fact, read
  through the registered trajectory-store seam — so consecutive rounds advance
  by exactly one and N rounds cover all N eligible positions: a bounded
  opportunity window with no new persisted scheduling state, no randomness and
  no clock. Non-fitting entries no longer terminate the scan; oversized entries
  are reported separately; the injection event carries selectionPolicy,
  eligibleCount, rotationStartIndex, the round ordinal that produced the
  selection, and schema-bounded dropped/oversized activation id lists (max 16)
  so truncation is explainable and traceable. The legacy FIFO prefix behavior
  remains the rollback baseline whenever no round ordinal is available.

## 0.7.10

### Patch Changes

- da4c731: Identity **writer** boundary (PRI-911A, third gate after the Type Boundary #1851 and the Activation Identity Boundary #1856): `pi_artifacts.source_principle_id` can now only ever hold a **canonical ledger UUID or NULL** — never title/`T-NN`/other display text. Audit trail: `docs/audit/identity-writer-hardening.md`.
  
  **W1 — DreamerRunner no longer carries an LLM-asserted identity.** The runner wrote `output.sourcePrincipleId` straight onto the artifact column; after `stripFabricatedCorePrincipleIds` the only value that can reach it is a Historical Core Principle registry id (`T-NN`), which is not a ledger principle. The column is now left empty and the assertion is reported via `dreamer_identity_assertion_not_carried`. The value still rides in `contentJson`, so the Activations console's Bug-O L1 'unlinked' display is unchanged — stamping the real identity remains ScribeRunner's ledger-verified job (PR #1856 I2).
  
  **W2 — EvaluatorRunner's rule stamp replaced its lenient chain.** Rule assembly previously resolved the identity through column → `contentJson.principleId` → `contentJson.sourcePrincipleId` → `principleDraft.title`, which is exactly how philosopher titles became durable identities in the column. Assembly now reads the bearer's `source_principle_id` column only, gates it through `canonicalLedgerPrincipleId` — the value-level gate split out of PR #1856's `resolveActivationPrincipleId`, so there is still exactly one UUID parser in the repo — and, when the host injects the new optional `EvaluatorRunnerDeps.ledgerIdentity.hasPrinciple`, verifies ledger membership. Outcomes: `evaluator_identity_stamp_success`, or the rule written with a NULL identity plus `evaluator_identity_stamp_failed` carrying `missing_identity` / `non_canonical_identity` / `invalid_identity` (`ambiguous_identity` stays with the bearer/lineage resolvers that can actually see multiplicity).
  
  **Rule assembly is deliberately NOT aborted on an unverified identity** — PR #1856 established that identity gaps are enforced at the publication boundary (rule preserved, no approval subject, no activation), so a wrong identity no longer silently becomes a lost candidate; `evaluator_rule_assembly_failed` keeps its structural meaning. All three production `EvaluatorRunner` construction sites (host-runtime consumer cycle, pd-cli `createEvaluatorRunnerDeps` shared by RuleHost and `runtime internalization run-once`) are wired with the ledger check; unwired callers keep the shape-only gate. The wiring is no longer
  grep-maintained: `identity-writer-production-wiring.test.ts` fails if a production construction site
  drops the injection (or bypasses the sanctioned `createEvaluatorRunnerDeps` factory), or if an identity
  event name drifts away from `TelemetryEventType`. Rollback = revert; no schema change, no data migration, no new flag.
- Updated dependencies [da4c731]

## 0.7.9

### Patch Changes

- 42f0f4a: Activation identity boundary is now **ledger-aware and end-to-end** (Phase 3, I2 + I3 — `docs/architecture/principle-identity-reconciliation.md`), fixing the Owner review of PR #1856 where the shape-only gate cut the live production chain.
  
  **I2 — production chain stamping (the missing half of the ADR §6).** `ScribeRunner` now resolves the ledger principle identity through the real chain and stamps it at write time: scribe context → dreamer artifact (`sourceDreamerArtifactId`) → dreamer task seed `diagnosticJson.candidateId` (fallback: the `dreamer-<candidateId>-<channel>` task-id spelling) → `ledger.listForCandidate` exactly-one. Stamping is fail-soft and observable (`identity_stamp_failed` / `identity_stamp_skipped` events; `task_succeeded` carries `sourcePrincipleId`) — an unresolvable or ambiguous chain writes the artifact unstamped instead of guessing. Requires the new optional `ScribeRunnerDeps.ledgerIdentity` dep; unwired callers are unchanged.
  
  **I3 — ledger membership, verified BEFORE the commit.** The gate moved out of the writers (they now only guard `kind` + `validationStatus`) into `ActivationDispatcher.resolveActivationIdentity`, which runs on **both** paths: `enqueueForApproval` (before the approval record — that record *is* the pre-commit state change) and `activateArtifact` (before the activation commit). Resolution states:
  - `direct_validated` — a stamped UUID that the ledger actually contains;
  - `candidate_lineage` — an unstamped artifact resolved through the dreamer lineage;
  - unresolved → `invalid_artifact`. A stamped-but-unknown UUID is data drift (`principle_not_in_ledger: <id>`) and never falls through to lineage guessing.
  
  UUID shape alone never proves membership. Writers no longer refuse identity-less artifacts (they lack ledger deps; the dispatcher is the single gate). Without `ledgerIdentity` deps the legacy strict UUID-shape boundary applies unchanged, so unwired callers keep prior behavior.
  
  Console / CLI / E2E fixtures were migrated to real ledger-backed UUID identities, and **all manual identity stamping in tests was removed** — the identity must now come from the production chain.
  
  **Every production dispatch site is now wired with ledger deps**, so the identity chain is not cut at any entry point:
  
  - `demo-story-a-runner` previously used the synthetic string `demo-principle-<runId>` as the artifact identity and built its dispatcher with no ledger deps — the new gate refused all three channels (`invalid_artifact`). It now mints a **real ledger principle** (`PrincipleTreeLedgerAdapter.writeProbationEntry`, `derivedFromPainIds: [demo-<runId>]`), stamps that UUID onto both artifacts (`makePrincipleArtifactRecord(runId, principleId)`), and passes `ledgerIdentity` to both dispatchers. The Story-A demo exercises the SAME identity contract production does instead of bypassing it.
  - `pd-cli` rollout-parity fixtures seed the durable ledger entry their scribe chain implies (a real principle UUID + `sourceRef`), matching what a production internalization produces.
  - The pd-console **E2E seed** (`scripts/e2e-seed.ts`) now seeds ledger-backed UUID identities for every `pi_artifact` it writes (10 stable UUIDs + `p-001`). Previously the seed pointed artifacts at non-UUID, non-ledger ids (`p-001`, `p-002`, `p-click-*`, `p-rulecode-*`), so under the fail-closed gate the happy-path approvals returned 500 (`no_principle_id_in_artifact`) and — worse — that gate reason **shadowed** the RuleHostWriter golden-trace schema check that `rule-host-writer-golden-trace.spec.ts` asserts. With ledger-resolved identities the gate passes and the schema check runs, so `golden_trace_schema_invalid` surfaces as the spec requires (its own regression contract). Verified locally: `focus-approve-flow` 2/2, `rule-host-writer-golden-trace` 4/4, BDD `focus-page` 1/1.
  - `resolveActivationPrincipleId` now **lowercase-normalizes** the resolved UUID: ledger keys come from `randomUUID()` (always lowercase), so an uppercase-but-shape-valid UUID previously missed `hasPrinciple` and was misreported as `principle_not_in_ledger`.
- Updated dependencies [42f0f4a]

## 0.7.8

### Patch Changes

- c7453ea: PR #1844 follow-up: the Governance Focus prompt-injection forecast and the PRI-890 approve-time budget check now read `buildLivePromptInjectionProjection` (host-runtime), which follows the SAME injection route the agent uses — with `abstraction_layer_v1` off (the live default) the forecast replays the plugin's PromptActivationReader → trimToBudget chain instead of always rendering with the shared-path directive wrapper. Previously a saturated 2000-char budget was over-forecast (~3/11 principles "injected" vs the real 9/11), so the Focus page badge and approve warnings overstated budget pressure. Principle selection, FIFO ordering, injection behavior and the budget algorithm are unchanged; parity and boundary regression tests pin the projection to the live path.
- 8b7b775: Security audit run-1 remediation (findings verified against eabbde6d, applied on ccc69252):
  
  - **RuleCode enforcement is now content-bound** (audit HIGH `rulecode-approval-content-unbound`): the production gate and the OpenClaw plugin RuleHost re-verify the current `pi_artifacts` row against the `activation_decisions.artifact_digest` recorded at Owner promotion time before compiling it. A workspace-local rewrite of `content_json` (or lineage fields) is now skipped with a structured `artifact_content_tampered` warning instead of silently executing unapproved code. Rows without a recorded decision (legacy activations) keep their prior behavior. Adds `mapPiArtifactRow`/`PiArtifactRow` exports (the single `pi_artifacts` row→snapshot mapping) so enforcement reproduces the promotion-time digest byte-for-byte.
  - **Replay evaluate is hard-bounded** (audit MEDIUM `rulecode.replay.in-process-evaluate-no-hard-timeout`): pre-activation replay runs each evaluate call through a precompiled vm script with a 2000ms hard timeout — a looping LLM-authored candidate now fails its replay case instead of hanging the console server, evaluator worker, or CLI process.
  - **Governance-store unavailability leaves a durable trace** (audit MEDIUM `gate-failopen-allow-on-state-corruption`): when `state.db` is missing or unreadable, the gate/plugin record a best-effort marker under `~/.pd/enforcement-health/` (outside the agent-writable workspace), and the console governance read model distinguishes "state.db deleted after initialization — enforcement degraded (fail-open)" from a never-initialized workspace.
  - **Console refuses unauthenticated non-loopback binds** (audit MEDIUM `pd-console-noauth-nonloopback-bind`): the loopback-only invariant now keys on the effective authentication state (token-less default included), not just the explicit `--no-auth` flag.
  - **Plugin honors an explicit conversation-access opt-out** (audit LOW `openclaw-plugin:conversation-access-autofix-overrides-explicit-owner-opt-out`): the auto-fix repairs only an absent `allowConversationAccess` flag; an explicit `false` (the documented turn-off) is preserved and surfaced as an honored Owner opt-out instead of being silently rewritten on every gateway start.

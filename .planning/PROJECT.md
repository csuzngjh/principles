# Principles - AI Agent Principle Evolution System

## What This Is

Principles is a principle-evolution system for AI coding agents. It detects pain signals, proposes candidate principles, gates them through trust and scoring, and promotes validated principles into active use. The repo also contains `ai-sprint-orchestrator`, a long-running multi-stage task runner.

## Core Value

AI agents improve their own behavior through a structured loop:

pain -> diagnosis -> principle -> gate -> active -> reflection -> training -> internalization

## Validated

- Runtime `Rule Host`, replay evaluation, and manual implementation lifecycle flows exist
- Nocturnal background reflection pipeline exists and can emit production-facing artifacts
- Minimal rule bootstrap and live replay validation shipped in `v1.12`
- CI and lint baseline are green from `v1.9.3`
- v1.19 Tech Debt Remediation: God classes split, type safety improved, queue tests added.
- Phase 0a: Universal PainSignal schema, StorageAdapter interface, FileStorageAdapter, hallucination detection, budget-aware injection, observability baselines.

## Active

- Adapter Abstraction: Decoupling OpenClaw-specific logic from the core evolution pipeline (Phase 0b).
- SDK Core Implementation: Implement universal SDK core with reference adapters and benchmarks (Phase 1).
- Cross-Domain Universality: Validating the system against non-coding domains (Phase 1.5).

## Out of Scope

- New UI/dashboard work
- New feature surface areas (outside SDK scope)
- LoRA or full fine-tune internalization paths

## Context

- Main runtime is being extracted from `packages/openclaw-plugin/src/` into `@principles/core`.
- High priority on interface stability (Semver) and performance benchmarks (p99 targets).
- CEO Plan: 2026-04-16-universal-agent-evolution-sdk.md defines the current strategic direction.

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| From zero build for SDK | SDK should be framework-agnostic; refactoring legacy code might bake in coupling | Active |
| evolution-worker is core | It's the functional core, not a god class to be arbitrarily split further | Active |
| Phase 1.5 Validation | N=2 (coding + 1) is not enough for "Universal" claim; need extreme case | Active |
| Freeze Semver after Ph 1.5 | Ensure stability only after cross-domain stress testing | Active |

## Current Milestone: v1.20 Universal SDK Foundation

**Goal:** Establish core interface contracts and functional hardening for the universal evolution engine.

**Target features:**
- Universal PainSignal & StorageAdapter interfaces
- Hardening: malformed signal validation, LLM hallucination detection
- Reference Adapters: Coding + 1 additional domain
- Cross-Domain Validation: Extreme case testing (e.g. Creative Writing)
- SDK Packaging: `@principles/core` with Semver

## Evolution

This document evolves at phase transitions and milestone boundaries.

**After each phase transition:**
1. Requirements invalidated? Move to Out of Scope with reason
2. Requirements validated? Move to Validated with phase reference
3. New requirements emerged? Add to Active
4. Decisions to log? Add to Key Decisions
5. "What This Is" still accurate? Update if drifted

**After each milestone:**
1. Full review of all sections
2. Core Value check
3. Audit Out of Scope
4. Update Context with current state
